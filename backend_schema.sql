-- > previous attempt.
--
-- Alternatively, the backend on startup will query for missed notifications and try to catch up on
-- its own. It will store the UUIDs of the notifications it has processed so that if the
-- notification is re-attempted, it will be a no-op if we've already processed it ourselves.
--
-- The other scenario is that the backend may experience network connectivity issue and our
-- acknowledgement of the notification may fail whilst having already processed the notification. In
-- that case, Apple will similarly retry the notification and we need to no-op in that situation as
-- well. This is all managed in this table.

-- Track notifications that we have successfully and failed to process from Google by its message
-- ID. Similar to Apple, if we have network failure we may receive repeated notifications that we
-- should ignore. Google tries to maintain a consistent delivery order but there is no guarantee.
-- Unlike Apple, there's no API to query missed notifications in which case we have to store these
-- notifications we saw ourselves.
--
-- The notification payload is wiped once the notification has been handled and we hold onto the
-- notifications until it has been handled AND the expiry timestamp has elapsed.
--
-- For Google the expiry is configured on the Google Cloud Pub/Sub interface and is currently set to
-- 7 days with an exponential backoff. On startup the unhandled notifications are loaded into the
-- runtime queue and re-attemped.
--
-- Typically if a notification fails, it might be because the notifications came out of order and
-- there's an earlier one that needs to be processed before proceeding. This table persists those
-- failed notifications across restarts as well as ensuring that with exponential backoff, there's
-- time inbetween to allow late notifications to arrive, be sorted into emit order and executed in
-- order.
